Concept for Plugin to Create Google Calendar Events via ChatGPT Text Prompts

Invitation for anyone to develop the ideas presented here:

The initial research and coding was performed by ChatGPT itself, and so needs attention from folks experienced in development to bring the concept to fruition.

I release this concept into the public domain and do not require or expect any compensation or rights to the realization/implementation of the project. I do plan to make use of the plugin, so please do notify me if this beomes reality by contacing: J [at] Rizzo-Weaver [dot] space

Thank you.
